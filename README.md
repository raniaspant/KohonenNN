# Simulating Kohonen network in 1D and 2D

* Mapping in (0,0) – (1,0) – (0,1) triangle
* Using η0 = 0.1, d0 = 3, T = 1000

Weights are initialized randomly in a custom defined rectangle within the triangle.

Both scripts produce plots throughout the iterations to show the changes in the weights' coordinates.
